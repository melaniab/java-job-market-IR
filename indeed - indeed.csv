Sr. Software Developer with either Java or Python or mix of the two.

Be where your talents are needed most. We constantly move from project to project, solving problems and moving on to the next. In a small team we wear many hats, but are rarely bored.
Build robust enterprise applications. We design and build applications to enable the success of our clients. Our applications enable the trading of millions of dollars in client accounts. Accurately. Optimally. Consistently.
Apply your knowledge of a problem domain. Understand where the industry is going? Think you can get there first? We encourage you to build features into your application that solve problems that will exist in the future, but that your users have yet to consider. Prove how well you organize your time.
Communicate your ideas. You have direct access to end users and decision makers who are looking for fresh perspectives. Help us map out the future.
Improve the scalability and robustness of our software environment. You might be using Python/Django, Java, Wildfly, Docker, Mesos, Zookeeper, Spark, Cassandra, MySQL, MS SQLServer and Ansible to deliver application services in a high uptime environment.

On the front-end, we're building sophisticated clients with HTML5/JavaScript (mostly React) and Native Mobile (iOS and Android). That's where we are today, but there's no telling how that might evolve over the next few years. We’re always trying new things to see what works for us and our clients.
