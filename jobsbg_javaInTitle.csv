Documaster started out with just a few enthusiastic people who had a mission to build the most lightweight, modern, and easy-to-use records management system in Norway. Five years later, we are an international company with more than 500 customers in Scandinavia, more than 70 employees in 3 countries, including Bulgaria (where one of our co-founders and core product development team are situated), and our ambition to make records management easy has grown worldwide.As a Documaster developer, you will learn the intricacies of electronic records management both in the public and private sector, and see how challenging it is to create appealing software that also complies with standards. Together with our interaction and visual designers, you will always be looking for ways to make the process of archiving and retrieving valuable documents as effortless and intuitive as possible.As a Documaster developer, you will learn the intricacies of electronic records management in Scandinavia and see how challenging it is to create great software that is also standards-compliant. Your key goal will be to make it easy for private and public sector organizations to archive their most valuable documents and to allow employees or the general public to easily find and retrieve these documents today as well as thirty years from today. You will be constantly looking for ways to breathe new life into old data.As a Java developer, you will be developing new functionality in our records management system and document processing server both of which run on Linux and are based on open-source technology.You will do data modeling while working with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and will learn to overcome the limitations of object-relational mapping frameworks when using Hibernate. Having to think about multiple threads executing the same code at the same time will become a part of your daily routine. This will be extremely valuable when you start improving the code that indexes documents and metadata in Solr, the code that OCRs documents with Tesseract and converts them to PDF/A, or the code that exports terabytes of data from the system and needs to do it efficiently.As a part of our team, you will also be designing and documenting web services, always considering their future use and backwards compatibility when a change is required. You will be writing unit and integration tests and configuring Bamboo build jobs to create Maven artifacts and push them to an artifact repository when a build runs successfully.You will be using Git to squash and reword commits, merge and rebase branches, and handle releases, bugfixes and hotfixes. You will do code reviews and have your code reviewed.Once you feel comfortable with the above, you will have the opportunity to occasionally tear off pieces of the system to refactor them. The goal will be to make the system better and keep the codebase small and easy to maintain.At Documaster, we take pride in our culture and achievements. Apart from being exceptional problem solvers, we are fun to hang around. We do not grow at any cost as an organization and have always been persistent in nurturing our collective values. In the most recent external employee satisfaction survey we took part in, we scored way above the average for the industry, and hope that this is a sign we are doing a good job as an employer.We love seeing motivated and satisfied people in the office every day. If you want to work in a team that constantly challenges you, and the job described here genuinely sparks your interest, you should get in touch with us right away. If you are the right match for our team we will surely offer you a competitive salary. On top of that, we have a stock options plan, a flexible benefits package tailored to your needs, and offer free training and certification programs. There are more goodies but we would like to keep them as pleasant surprises.Send us your CV in English and tell us in five sentences why you find this job interesting, and how you will help us be a stronger team.

						 						 	Our passion is developing and using cutting-edge technology to deliver precisely what a customer ordered, exactly when they want it.

It sounds easy - but when Ocado customers typically order 50 to 60 different products from the 48,000 products we stock, and they decide on a 1 hour window for us to deliver all of these to them, this gets very difficult, very quickly. We handle over a quarter of a million orders every week. Just imagine the complexity!!

At Ocado Technology, we are creating leading-edge software systems and technology for the digital supermarket of tomorrow; our website and mobile apps trigger our streamlined supply chain, highly-automated warehouses and delivery systems to kick into life and deliver orders with incredible accuracy - we are very proud to have some of the happiest customers of any online grocery company.

We are not resting on our laurels, we have a number of exciting and top secret projects we are currently working on, and we see innovation playing a vital role to our continued success.  We are using Java in some projects, Scala in others, a bit of embedded C and C++ for our robotics, some Amazon Web Services and the Google Cloud Platform, Docker, we're developing for Android, using agile methodologies (some teams do Kanban, some do Scrum, and some use other methods) and some teams do TDD and some continuous delivery - there is way too much to list here! This is all happening right now, and we're always discovering new technologies and deciding what we can be using in the future.

You have some experience, perhaps a lot, and you are excited to learn; you are creative, love to contribute and make a difference. We are here to give you the support you need so that you can develop amazing products that make a real difference in our customers' lives.

We are Ocado Technology and our passion is cutting-edge technology and delivering the best experience for our customers. What's your passion?

Why We Do It? We care.
We care about our customers, we care about each other, and we care about producing great software.


CUSTOMERS We admit that the organization we most want to see succeed is our own. But we’ll quickly acknowledge that we can’t win unless our clients win. There’s no way around this symbiotic relationship. Fortunately, we genuinely love to see our partners have breakthroughs in top-line growth, innovation and efficiency.
                                  


PEOPLE We care about individuals and humankind. That’s why we invest in talent and push people to do their best work. That’s also why we have given colleagues help when they’ve encountered personal crises; paid for surgeries people couldn’t afford; funded capital improvements and arts projects to improve our communities; and closed the office to attend colleagues' weddings.
                                  


TEAM If you’ve ever experienced the excitement that comes from being part a high-functioning team, you’ll understand why people matter. Trust. Accountability. Purpose. Self-confidence. These are all part of that exhilaration, but the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Great teams can get you through the tough times and can unlock greater potential than a group of individual contributors ever will.
                                    


SOFTWARE  We care about the code that we write. We take pride in it. We constantly try to improve on it. We adopt best practices when they suit us. We geek out over data and make it work for us. We are not afraid to try the latest & greatest and to support the last year’s. We are ready to make mistakes and learn from them. We know that building great software requires a lot from us and we committed to it.
