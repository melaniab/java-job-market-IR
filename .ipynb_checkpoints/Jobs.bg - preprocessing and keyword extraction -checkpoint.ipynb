      "Documaster started out with just a few enthusiastic people who had a mission to build the most lightweight, modern, and easy-to-use records management system in Norway. Five years later, we are an international company with more than 500 customers in Scandinavia, more than 70 employees in 3 countries, including Bulgaria (where one of our co-founders and core product development team are situated), and our ambition to make records management easy has grown worldwide.As a Documaster developer, you will learn the intricacies of electronic records management both in the public and private sector, and see how challenging it is to create appealing software that also complies with standards. Together with our interaction and visual designers, you will always be looking for ways to make the process of archiving and retrieving valuable documents as effortless and intuitive as possible.As a Documaster developer, you will learn the intricacies of electronic records management in Scandinavia and see how challenging it is to create great software that is also standards-compliant. Your key goal will be to make it easy for private and public sector organizations to archive their most valuable documents and to allow employees or the general public to easily find and retrieve these documents today as well as thirty years from today. You will be constantly looking for ways to breathe new life into old data.As a Java developer, you will be developing new functionality in our records management system and document processing server both of which run on Linux and are based on open-source technology.You will do data modeling while working with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and will learn to overcome the limitations of object-relational mapping frameworks when using Hibernate. Having to think about multiple threads executing the same code at the same time will become a part of your daily routine. This will be extremely valuable when you start improving the code that indexes documents and metadata in Solr, the code that OCRs documents with Tesseract and converts them to PDF/A, or the code that exports terabytes of data from the system and needs to do it efficiently.As a part of our team, you will also be designing and documenting web services, always considering their future use and backwards compatibility when a change is required. You will be writing unit and integration tests and configuring Bamboo build jobs to create Maven artifacts and push them to an artifact repository when a build runs successfully.You will be using Git to squash and reword commits, merge and rebase branches, and handle releases, bugfixes and hotfixes. You will do code reviews and have your code reviewed.Once you feel comfortable with the above, you will have the opportunity to occasionally tear off pieces of the system to refactor them. The goal will be to make the system better and keep the codebase small and easy to maintain.At Documaster, we take pride in our culture and achievements. Apart from being exceptional problem solvers, we are fun to hang around. We do not grow at any cost as an organization and have always been persistent in nurturing our collective values. In the most recent external employee satisfaction survey we took part in, we scored way above the average for the industry, and hope that this is a sign we are doing a good job as an employer.We love seeing motivated and satisfied people in the office every day. If you want to work in a team that constantly challenges you, and the job described here genuinely sparks your interest, you should get in touch with us right away. If you are the right match for our team we will surely offer you a competitive salary. On top of that, we have a stock options plan, a flexible benefits package tailored to your needs, and offer free training and certification programs. There are more goodies but we would like to keep them as pleasant surprises.Send us your CV in English and tell us in five sentences why you find this job interesting, and how you will help us be a stronger team.                                                 \n",
